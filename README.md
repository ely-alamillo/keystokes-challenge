# Keystoke's MERN Stack Developer Challenge

## Project Live [Here](http://keystokes-ely.herokuapp.com/)

## Things I didn't get around to:

* Didn't finish implementing photo upload
* Error on forms aren't being displayed, but I have access to them
* better styling, ran out of time

The project requirements are listed below:

* As a user I should be able to view a dashboard with your name, a profile picture and a description of yourself.
* As a user I should be able to update the following:
  * Name
  * Description of yourself
  * Profile Picture
* As a user I should be able to save the changes that I made to the above listed items.
* As a user, I should be able to view the profiles of anyone that has submitted/created a profile through the app.
* The backend should reflect changes that can be made.

P.S. For bonus points feel free to add in some sort of O-Auth component.
